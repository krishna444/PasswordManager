		This is information technology world and information security is being
		one of the challenges in the current society. Every person has several
		accounts and so several PASSWORDS! The modern securiy systems do not
		accept simple passord, they want to provide somehow difficult
		password, which is even difficult for the user to remember it. After
		several day of account inactivity, it is highly probable the the
		password could be forgotten. So, what can we do? We create new
		complicated password by clicking <strong>forgot password</strong>
		link, and again forget after a few days.
	</p>
	<p>With this problem scenerio, I have thought of storing encrypted
		password somewhere online, and get it when we need. And this project
		aims to fulfull almost all this requirement. This website application
		stores password information encrypted, so nobody can see or tamper
		your password. Upon request, the password will be send to your email
		addree, so, there is no chances of password-vulnerability.</p>

	<p>After completion of this project, I will develop mobile application
		for Android, and most probably windows and iphone versions.</p>

	<p>Any ideas or suggestion are highly welcomed!</p>
